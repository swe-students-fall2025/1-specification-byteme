## Product Vision Statement

For adopters and shelters frustrated by scattered listings and slow communication, **Perport** is a mobile app that streamlines communication and makes pet adoption faster and easier.

## User Requirements



- As an adopter, I want to browse available pets by type (dog, cat, small animal, etc.) so that I can quickly find pets that match my preferences.

- As an adopter, I want to see detailed pet profiles with photos, age, breed, and temperament so that I can make an informed decision before contacting the shelter.

- As an adopter, I want to favorite or save pets I’m interested in so that I can easily return to their profiles later.

- As an adopter, I want to apply filters (e.g., age, size, breed, location) so that I can narrow down my search to pets that fit my lifestyle.

- As an adopter, I want to message shelters directly through the app so that I can ask questions and arrange visits without delay.

- As a shelter staff member, I want to quickly post new pet listings with photos and descriptions so that adopters can see them right away.

- As a shelter staff member, I want to update pet status (e.g., “available,” “adopted,” “pending”) so that adopters always have accurate information.

- As an adopter, I want to receive notifications when a shelter responds to my message so that I can reply promptly.

- As a shelter staff member, I want to view and manage all incoming adoption requests in one place so that I can respond efficiently.

- As an adopter, I want the app to suggest pets based on my saved preferences so that I can discover new matches I might not have searched for.

## Clickable Prototype

The wireframe diagrams outline a user-friendly pet adoption app built around a standard bottom navigation bar (Home, Favorites, Messages, Profile). The core flow allows users to browse pets on the home screen, filter by species, view detailed profiles, and submit an adoption application, culminating in a confirmation screen. The design focuses on clarity and ease of use.
